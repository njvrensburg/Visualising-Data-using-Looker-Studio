# Visualising-Data-using-Looker-Studio
Practicing Data Storytelling and Visualising Tools for the First Time

This project was undertaken  during my Data Analytics studies with Turing College as a submission for the 'Presentations & Soft Skills ' sprint in the Communicating Analysis Results module.

Within this module, we were exposed to two great books from which I have taken a lot of value and  made a very deliberate effort to try exercise in the execution of this task. The first was "Storytelling with Data" by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic; an excellent and easy to read book for us data nerds and for the less data inclined alike. The second was "Communicating with Data" by Carl Allchin. Both of these texts do a brilliant job teaching best practices around chart selection and design in order to best communicate with your audience.

Communication of Analysis is an aspect of the Data Analysts role which I often feel may not be appreciated or priortised as highly as it is deserves by many Data Analysts in the field. It is my goal to excel in this area. I strongly believe that my role as a Data Analyst is to be able to bridge the gap between the complexity of data and reveal the gems buried within to stakeholders to affect the greatest change in the project or business concerned.

Data makes me excited. It is my aim to be able to make sense of the complexity of the data for my audience and hopefully make those less data-inclined more comfortable consuming the analysis and hopefully even elicit the same excitement where possible. Data is beautiful and can allow us to achieve great things if utilised correctly.
